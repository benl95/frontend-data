# functional programming

## What does this project do?

In this project I'm converting the answers that are given to the question: 'What is your favorite day of the week'. The answers are given in numbers and I'm converting these numbers to actual days. For the survey participants that didn't answer this question a 'No input' answer will be given. 

## Which features have I used?

Using a 'hack' given by Robert and Laurens I retrieve the data using a JSON file and store that JSON into a function to return the data. I will be searching through the data using a variable where the 'search action' will be stored. The data will eventually be pushed into an array using a for loop and a push method.

To convert the values to actual days I'm using a switch case in where the cases are tested and converted. 

## Which data am I using?

In the first week we will be experiment with functional patterns using the CMD students dataset. I've chose to clean up the favorite day of the week column. 

## Installation guide

Navigate to the desired directory in your terminal:

`cd desktop`

Once you've reached the desired directory paste the following code in your terminal:

`https://github.com/benl95/functional-programming.git`

You can now open index.html and open the console to check the array in which the survey answers are stored.
