# functional programming

This repo is created to process data provided by RDW in commisioned by The Volkskrant. The given assignment is to create interesting data visualizations from the RDW data, using D3.js, that The Volkskrant can eventually use for articles. The data that is provided by the RDW (Dutch Vehicle Authority) contains parking data with many different variables that can be put together, made relationships with, and combined to recognize interesting insights about this data. More about this project can in read in the [Debriefing](https://github.com/benl95/functional-programming/wiki/1.-Debriefing)

## Installation guide
